# 💹 Algorithmic Trading Using Machine Learning & Quant Strategies

## 📌 Project Overview

This project leverages **machine learning**, **quantitative finance**, and **time series analysis** to build and evaluate algorithmic trading strategies. It simulates real-world financial decision-making using historical price data to detect patterns, optimize trades, and evaluate portfolio performance over time.

> 🎯 Objective: Build data-driven, predictive models that enable **automated buy/sell decisions** based on patterns in market behavior.

## 🧠 What This Project Demonstrates

- ✅ Use of **ML algorithms** (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.) to predict price movement  
- ✅ Application of **technical indicators** (SMA, RSI, MACD) in feature engineering  
- ✅ Backtesting trading strategies with historical price data  
- ✅ Calculation of **Sharpe Ratio, Returns, Accuracy**, and other performance metrics  
- ✅ Clear modular breakdown: *data ingestion → feature engineering → model training → strategy evaluation*
